# Games-Created-by-Jake-Lahr
Here are files for all the prototype games I have made for class and in my free time. Each folder includes sceenshots of games as well as files to download games. Some of these games were designed for Mobile Devices
I appologize for the mess on my github. Have never really used it before and am currently building a website for my games. Please contact me if there are any issues through my mail sent with resume.
